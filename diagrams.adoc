= Hello, Diagrams!

NOTE: Although you could enclose the alt text in single quotes to escape the comma, doing so implicitly enables substitutions.
Unless you need substitutions to be applied to the alt text, prefer using double quotes as the enclosure.

[NOTE]
Thank you.

[WARNING] 
Please note it

[TIP]
Something here

[CAUTION]
Something new

GitHub recently added support for including https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid#readme[Mermaid] diagrams in Markdown files. The good news is that it works for AsciiDoc files as well. Here is an example:

[source,mermaid]
....
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>Alice: Great!
....

[source,mermaid]
----
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>Alice: Great!
----

The catch? The way it works for AsciiDoc is similar to how it works for Markdown. Here is the source code for the above diagram:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[source,mermaid]
....
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>Alice: Great!
....
----

When a source code block marked with `mermaid` is encountered, GitHub generates an iframe that takes the raw Mermaid code and turns it into diagram using Mermaid.js. This approach is common workaround for the lack of custom blocks in Makrdown. The correct way to add diagram in AsciiDoc is to use https://docs.asciidoctor.org/diagram-extension/latest/#creating-a-diagram[custom diagram block], in this case `[mermaid]`:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[mermaid]
....
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>Alice: Great!
....
----

Using code block to display Mermaid.js diagrams works only in GitHub and would be displayed as source code by AsciiDoc tools such as Asciidoctor. Using `mermaid` block works with Asciidoctor, given https://docs.asciidoctor.org/diagram-extension/latest/[Asciidoctor Diagram] extension is enabled, but not in GitHub. This means that the same file would be displayed differently in GitHub and in HTML file generated by Asciidoctor. This is not an issue if the file is intended to be rendered only in GitHub, e.g. Wiki pages. But what if we want to generate HTML documentation from the AsciiDoc files and in the same time to get the diagrams rendered in GitHub?

== Conditional processing

Thanks to @umutsahin for suggesting this approach. https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/conditionals/[Conditional preprocessor directives] allow content to be included only if given attribute is set. For example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
\ifdef::env-github[]
[source,mermaid]
\endif::[]
----

would add `[source,mermaid]` if the `env-github` is set, which is the case when the document is rendered on GitHub. The above could be shortened to `ifdef::env-github\[[source,mermaid]]`. The following code would properly display diagram when the document is rendered both on GitHub and using Asciidoctor.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[mermaid]
\ifdef::env-github[[source,mermaid]]
....
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>Alice: Great!
....
----

== Custom preprocessor

Another solution is to use https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctorj/latest/extensions/preprocessor/[custom preprocessor]. Here is an example using https://asciidoctor.github.io/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin/master/user-guide/#_as_inline_script[Asciidoctor Gradle plugin]:

[source, groovy]
----
asciidoctorj {
    modules {
       diagram.use() 
       diagram.version '2.2.1' 
    }

    docExtensions {
        preprocessor {
            document, reader ->
            List<String> lines = reader.readLines();          
            List<String> newLines = new ArrayList<String>();
            for (String line: lines) {
                if("[source,mermaid]".equals(line)) {
                    line = "[mermaid]"
                }
                newLines.add(line)
            }
            reader.restoreLines(newLines)
        }
    }
}
----

It would replace `[source,mermaid]` with `[mermaid]`. This way the same AsciiDoc file would look the same both in GitHub and in the generated HTML file.
